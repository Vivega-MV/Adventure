Doctype, Meta Tags, and CSS
The doctype should define the page as an HTML5 document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
A meta tag should define the character set to be UTF-8:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
A viewport meta tag should make the web site work on all devices and screen resolutions:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
W3.CSS should take care of all our styling needs and all device and browser differences:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/3/w3.css">
To learn more about styling with W3.CSS, please visit our W3.CSS Tutorial.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/3/w3.css">
